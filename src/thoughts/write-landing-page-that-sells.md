# How to write a landing page that sells

## 5 mistakes to avoid to write a damn good landing page

I created 20+ startups and here's what you need to convert visitors into customers: **Create a damn good hero section on your landing page.**

Here are 5 mistakes I see solopreneurs make, and how to fix them.

Estimated reading time: 3 min 46 sec.

## 1. Your brand (name + logo) doesn't matter

I see websites with a massive 56px brand name and enormous logo in the center. Yes, your brand matters. But only to you.

Internet is crowded. People have no time. They aren't looking for a new brand with a cool name. They want solutions to their problems. And your brand name isn't one of them (unless you're Nike or Apple).

**Let's fix it:**

- Make your brand name and logo smaller. 18 pixels max. for the font, and 32 pixels max. for the logo.
- Alight them at the top left corner.
- Make your brand name super simple (i.e. Zoom, Stripe, Butter) or objective-oriented (ShipFast, MakeLogo, HeadshotPro).

## 2. Your headline does 80% of the job

This is the first part of your site that people will read. It's like the first Tinder profile picture or a YouTube thumbnail. Miss it, and they'll leave.

**Let's fix it:**

- Every site needs a headline (I've seen some without).
- The font size should be BIG. 36px to 48px is a good font size
- The headline copy should answer this question: *Why should a stranger stay on your site for more than 10 seconds?* Write about the pain it's relieving, the problem it's solving, or the pleasure it's giving. This could be a dedicated issue, let me know if you want to read more.
- Align your headline in the center or on the left if you have a product demo on the right.
- Write 5 variations. Send them to 5 friends. After 24 hours, delete the message. Ask which one they remember. Pick that one.

## 3. People don't trust you yet

Asking for money, or even just an email is a lot on the internet. There have been too many scams and humans are risk-averse. If there's no social proof on your site, the conversion rate will plummet.

**Let's fix it:**

- Don't call your users, users. They are students, product managers, or solopreneurs.
- Don't fake it at all. People are really good at spotting suspicious stuff. If it seems suspicious, people will leave in a second. Confused shoppers don't buy.
- Get testimonials before you launch. DM the right people on Twitter, post in the right subreddit, or ask relevant friends.

## 4. Let me try it!

Echoing the previous point: Asking for money, or even just an email is a lot on the internet.

*Is it worth my time?* People want to see what's in it for them.

**This is how you show them:**

- Add a demo of your product on the right side, or in the center, under the headline/supporting headline/CTA block.
- An image is good. A video is better. A demo is best.
- Remove clutter, especially if your product is complex. You just need to show the most important feature.

## 5. OK--Can I buy it now?

Visitors on your landing page aren't users. They are just a little bit interested in what you have to offer. Make it very easy for them to start once they're ready.

**Let's fix the Call-To-Action:**

- Your CTA should be a big button of the same color at different locations of your site.
- Don't add other CTAs. If you have a log-in button, use a neutral color or a link.
- Don't bury your call-to-action button somewhere on the page. Add one in the hero section, usually under the headline/supporting headline block.
- Avoid *Get Started* or *Sign Up*. Remind the benefits to the user. Use this formula: Verb + Benefit. *Learn Korean now, Get your headshots, Make my logo.*
- Answer objections in a small paragraph under the CTA:

  - *I bet it's expensive* → Start for free

  - *Another subscription...* → One-time payment

Finally, launch your website as soon as possible and find out how people react. If there isn't much conversion, try tweaking your headline for the most impact.
